# Down Again

A mockup project made to explore some concepts.

## Instructions

1. `node --version` — ensure you're running Node 7+
2. `npm install` — install dependencies
3. `npm run start` — build the app and start a node server

The app should be available at `http://localhost:8080/`. This isn't a production app, so the code isn't transpiled. Nevertheless, it should work in the following browsers:

- Chrome 56+
- Firefox 51+
